# Changelog v1.1.6

### Added
- A new feature called Trigger.setup()
    ```js
    Trigger.setup(obj_name, {
        1: ()=>{
            command;
            command;
        },
        2: ()=>{
            command;
            command;
        },
        3: ()=>{
            command;
            command;
        },
    });
    ```

### Changed
- For loop will now accept variable instead of just integer
- Optimize built-in functions by directly calling the command instead of creating a new function if there's only a single command inside the brackets

---

## Dev section
- Make for loop accept var
- In rightclick_setup and player_rejoin, if len(commands)==1, don't create a new function

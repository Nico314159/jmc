# Changelog v1.1.12

### Added
- New switch case statement used for [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) ( O(longn) algorithm for optimizaiton.)
    - Can't add default
    - `break;` doesn't actually do anything
    - Can only start with 1 and go on in ascending order and no skipping a number
    ```js
    switch($var) {
        case 1:
            <command>;
            <command>;
            ...
            break;
        case 2:
            <command>;
            <command>;
            ...
            break;
        case 3:
            <command>;
            <command>;
            ...
            break;
        case 4:
            <command>;
            <command>;
            ...
            break;
        }
    ```

### Changed
- Make if/else as optimized as possible, by terminating the `execute if` call if the condition fails
- Pressing ESC no longer exits GUI

### Fixed
- In the else function, it'll no longer set `__tmp__` to 1

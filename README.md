# JavaScript-like Minecraft functions

# (JMC)

A compiler for compiling .jmc file (custom language) to minecraft datapack.
The language is _inspired_ from JavaScript.

## Why use JMC

JMC allows you to write minecraft functions in a better language (.jmc) which is more readable and easier to write.
For example, you can declare multiple function in a single file and whitespaces no longer matter which means you can split a single command into multiple line

Normal function from .mcfunction file will not works in JMC, the syntax is almost entirely different.

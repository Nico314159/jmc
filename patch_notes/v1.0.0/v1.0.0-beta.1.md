## Dev section

1. Fix for loop
    - Change Re.var to r'(\$[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+)'
    - Call capture_for_loop before capture_if_else
    - Add logger in `log.py`
    - logger now debug version
    - Allow flow controls inside flow controls inside flow controls and so on...
    with multi function class and file "recursion". (I'm so big brain lol)
        - Flow controls are now caled from Function instead of compile
        - All flow controls' imports are in the `__init__` method to avoid circular import
        - If there's a flow control recursion it'll keep doing a recursion until the flow controll classes are no longer called which will end the recursion

1. Fix `<var>-=<int>`
    - Change Re.var to r'(\$[a-zA-Z0-9._]+)'
